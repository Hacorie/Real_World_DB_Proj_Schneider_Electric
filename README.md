Installation Notes
------------------
To run the system, simply host this repository on a php enabled server. You may need to modify the permissions of the 'files' directory to allow PHP to store user uploaded files there.

Directory Strucuture
---------------------
The base directory contains most of the user-facing pages. The include directory has a couple general files that are included in most other files. The db_scripts directory contains sql scripts to create, populate, and drop our database.
